# FAIR-Style Cyber Loss Modeling

This notebook establishes a baseline cyber risk loss model using FAIR-style concepts.
The goal is to translate cybersecurity risk into **financial exposure**, not technical severity.

Outputs from this notebook:
- Annualized Loss Exposure (ALE)
- Loss distribution (not a single point estimate)
- Tail risk metrics for executive decision-making
