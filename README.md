# Cyber-Risk-Quantification-Financial-Modeling

## Why This Exists
This repository demonstrates how cybersecurity risks can be quantified, modeled, and expressed in financial terms using FAIR-style analysis and Monte Carlo simulations. It is designed for security leaders, risk executives, and finance stakeholders, not just engineers.

## What This Covers
- FAIR-style loss modeling
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Scenario-based cyber risk analysis
- Control effectiveness and ROI modeling

## Who This Is For
- CISOs and security leaders
- Risk and compliance teams
- Finance and executive stakeholders

## Key Outputs
- Annualized Loss Exposure (ALE)
- Loss distributions and tail risk
- ROI of security investments
